# ⚡ QUICK START - Test The Fixes Now!

**All 3 errors are FIXED! Follow these steps to test everything.**

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Restart Everything (CRITICAL!)

```powershell
# Stop all running processes (Ctrl+C in each terminal)

# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd server
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend  
cd client
npm run dev
```

**Wait for:**
- Backend: `Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8002`
- Frontend: `Local: http://localhost:5173`

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Test in Browser

### A) Open the App
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Sign in (Gmail or Phone)
3. Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab

### B) Look for Success Logs
```
✅ GOOD LOGS TO SEE:
🔐 Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN
🔐 Attempting session bridge...
✅ Session bridge successful
✅ Socket manager initialized with session bridge
🔌 Creating socket connection to: http://localhost:8002
✅ Socket connected successfully

❌ BAD - If you see these:
❌ Session bridge failed: 500
❌ API_CONFIG is not defined
❌ WebSocket is closed before connection
```

## 🎮 Step 3: Test Real-Time Features

### Test 1: Dark Room Chat
1. Go to **Arena** tab
2. Click **Dark Room**
3. Join any room
4. Send a message
5. ✅ Message should appear instantly

### Test 2: Hangout Rooms
1. Go to **Arena** tab
2. Click **Hangout** tab
3. Create or join a room
4. Send a message
5. ✅ Message should appear instantly

### Test 3: Group Chats
1. Go to **Vibe** section
2. Open any group chat
3. Send a message
4. ✅ Message should appear instantly

---

## ✅ Step 4: Verify in Supabase

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Click **Table Editor**
3. Check tables:
   - `user_sessions` - Should have 1 row (your session)
   - `refresh_tokens` - Should have 1 row (your token)

---

## 🔍 Quick Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Session bridge failed: 500"
**Fix:** Backend not running or wrong .env
```bash
# Check backend terminal for errors
# Verify SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in server/.env
```

### ❌ "WebSocket closed before connection"
**Fix:** Session bridge needs to complete first
```bash
# Check console for "Session bridge successful" log
# If missing, backend might not be running
```

### ❌ "Table not found"
**Fix:** Migration didn't run
```bash
# Check Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor
# Look for user_sessions table
# If missing, re-run: mcp_supabase_apply_migration
```

## 🎯 Alternative: Use Test Script

1. First, **sign in** to the app (localhost:5173)
2. Open `test-complete-auth-flow.html` in browser
3. Click buttons **in order:**
   - ✅ Check Table
   - ✅ Test Bridge  
   - ✅ Test Socket
4. All 3 should turn GREEN ✅
