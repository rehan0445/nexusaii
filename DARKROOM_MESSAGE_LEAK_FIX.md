# Dark Room Message Leak Fix - Complete ✅

## Problem Summary

**Issue**: When users created a new Dark Room group or switched between groups, random messages from other rooms would appear in the current room. Messages from rooms the user was previously in would "leak" into the newly selected room.

## Root Cause

The problem was **missing room leave functionality**. Here's what was happening:

1. User joins Room A → Socket joins Room A ✅
2. User switches to Room B → Socket joins Room B ✅
3. **Socket never leaves Room A** ❌
4. User is now in BOTH Room A and Room B simultaneously
5. Messages from both rooms appear in the UI 🐛

### Technical Details

**Socket.IO Room Management Issue:**
- When `socket.join(roomId)` is called, the socket is added to that room
- Without calling `socket.leave(roomId)`, the socket stays in ALL previously joined rooms
- Server broadcasts messages to ALL sockets in a room using `io.to(roomId).emit()`
- Client receives messages from ALL rooms they're in, even if they switched away

**Missing Implementation:**
- No `leave-room` event handler on server
- No `leave-room` call on client when switching rooms
- No cleanup when component unmounts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server-Side: Added `leave-room` Event Handler

**File**: `server/app.js`

Added a new socket event handler that:
- Removes the socket from the Socket.IO room using `socket.leave(roomId)`
- Removes user from database tracking (`darkroom_room_users` table)
- Updates the room's user count
- Broadcasts updated user count to remaining users
- Confirms room leave to the client

```javascript
socket.on('leave-room', async (data) => {
  const roomId = typeof data === 'string' ? data : (data?.groupId || data?.roomId);

  try {
    // Leave the Socket.IO room
    socket.leave(roomId);

    // Remove user from database
    await DarkroomService.removeUserFromRoom(socket.id);

    // Update user count in database
    const userCountResult = await DarkroomService.updateRoomUserCount(roomId);

    // Send updated user count to remaining users
    io.to(roomId).emit('user-count-update', {
      roomId: roomId,
      count: userCountResult.userCount || 0
    });

    // Confirm successful room leave
    socket.emit('room-left', {
      roomId: roomId,
      success: true
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error leaving room:', error);
  }
});
```

### 2. Client-Side: Leave Previous Room Before Joining New One

**File**: `client/src/pages/arena/DarkRoomTab.tsx`

**Enhanced `joinRoomWithMessages` function:**
```javascript
// Leave previous room first to avoid receiving messages from multiple rooms
if (selectedDarkroomGroup && selectedDarkroomGroup.id !== group.id && socket) {
  console.log(`👋 [DarkRoomTab] Leaving previous room: ${selectedDarkroomGroup.id}`);
  socket.emit('leave-room', { groupId: selectedDarkroomGroup.id });
  
  // Wait a bit for the leave to process
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
}
```

### 3. Client-Side: Enhanced Message Filtering

**Added extra safety check in `receive-message` handler:**
```javascript
socket.on('receive-message', (data: any) => {
  // Only add message if it's for the currently selected room
  if (selectedDarkroomGroup && data.groupId !== selectedDarkroomGroup.id) {
    console.log('⚠️ Ignoring message from different room:', data.groupId);
    return;
  }
  
  // ... rest of message handling
});
```

This provides defense-in-depth: even if socket rooms aren't properly managed, messages from other rooms won't appear in the UI.

### 4. Client-Side: Cleanup on Unmount

**Enhanced cleanup when component unmounts:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (socket) {
      // Leave current room on unmount
      if (selectedDarkroomGroup) {
        socket.emit('leave-room', { groupId: selectedDarkroomGroup.id });
      }
      
      // Remove all event listeners
      socket.off('room-history');
      socket.off('receive-message');
      socket.off('room-left');
      // ... other listeners
      socket.disconnect();
    }
  };
}, [socket, selectedDarkroomGroup]);
```

### 5. Client-Side: Added Room Left Confirmation Listener

```javascript
socket.on('room-left', (data: any) => {
  if (data.success) {
    console.log(`✅ Successfully left room: ${data.roomId}`);
  } else {
    console.error(`❌ Failed to leave room: ${data.roomId}`, data.error);
  }
});
```

## How It Works Now

### The Complete Room Switching Flow:

```
1. User is in Room A
2. User clicks to join Room B
3. ✅ Client emits 'leave-room' for Room A
4. ✅ Server removes socket from Room A
5. ✅ Server updates Room A user count
6. ✅ Server confirms room leave
7. ✅ Client emits 'join-room' for Room B
8. ✅ Server adds socket to Room B only
9. ✅ Server sends Room B message history
10. ✅ User only receives messages from Room B
```

### Defense-in-Depth Strategy:

1. **Primary**: Proper socket room management (leave before join)
2. **Secondary**: Message filtering on client (ignore messages from other rooms)
3. **Tertiary**: Cleanup on component unmount (leave room when navigating away)

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Room Switching

1. Open Dark Room in your browser
2. Join Room A and send a test message: "Message in Room A"
3. Switch to Room B
4. Check console for: `👋 [DarkRoomTab] Leaving previous room: <room-a-id>`
5. ✅ Verify you DON'T see "Message in Room A" in Room B
6. Send a message in Room B: "Message in Room B"
7. ✅ Verify only "Message in Room B" appears

### Test 2: Create New Room

1. Join an existing room with messages
2. Create a brand new room
3. ✅ Verify the new room is EMPTY (no messages from previous room)
4. Send a message in the new room
5. ✅ Verify only your new message appears

### Test 3: Multi-Room Test (Advanced)

1. Open 2 browser windows/tabs
2. **Window 1**: Join Room A
3. **Window 2**: Join Room B
4. **Window 1**: Send message "Test A"
5. ✅ **Window 2**: Should NOT see "Test A"
6. **Window 2**: Send message "Test B"
7. ✅ **Window 1**: Should NOT see "Test B"

### Test 4: Component Unmount

1. Join a Dark Room group
2. Navigate to a different tab (Hangout, Companion Chat, etc.)
3. Check server console for: `✅ User left Dark Room: <room-id>`
4. ✅ Verify user count decreased for that room

### Test 5: Console Log Verification

When switching rooms, you should see these logs in browser console:

```
👋 [DarkRoomTab] Leaving previous room: room-xyz-123
✅ Successfully left room: room-xyz-123
🔗 [DarkRoomTab] Joining socket room: room-abc-456 with alias: YourAlias
✅ [DarkRoomTab] Successfully joined room room-abc-456
```

If you see:
```
⚠️ Ignoring message from different room: <different-room-id>
```

This means the safety filter caught a leaked message (shouldn't happen after this fix, but provides defense-in-depth).

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:

1. **Room Leave Notification**:
   - Show toast: "Left Room A, joined Room B"
   - Visual feedback for users

2. **Active Room Indicator**:
   - Highlight currently active room
   - Show which room you're connected to

3. **Leave All Rooms on Logout**:
   - Cleanup all rooms when user logs out
   - Prevent stale sessions across login sessions

4. **Room History Limit**:
   - Only keep last N rooms in memory
   - Prevent users from being in too many rooms

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing leaked messages

**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Restart the server: `cd server && npm start`
4. Clear old socket connections from database

### Issue: Can't join new room

**Solution**:
1. Check if you properly left the previous room
2. Look for `room-left` confirmation in console
3. Verify socket is connected: check for `✅ Socket connected`
4. Check server logs for errors

### Issue: User count not decreasing

**Solution**:
1. Check if `leave-room` event is being emitted
2. Verify server `leave-room` handler is running
3. Check database connection
4. Run the user count cleanup script
