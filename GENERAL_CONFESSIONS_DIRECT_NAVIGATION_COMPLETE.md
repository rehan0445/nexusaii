const handleCollegeClick = (collegeId: string) => {
  setSelectedCollege(collegeId);
  setIsAnimating(true);
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    // For general confessions, go directly to the confessions page
    if (collegeId === 'general') {
      navigate(`/campus/${collegeId}/confessions`);
    } else {
      navigate(`/campus/${collegeId}`);
    }
  }, 800);
};
```
