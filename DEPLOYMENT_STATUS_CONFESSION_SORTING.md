## 🚀 Railway Deployment Status

### **Auto-Deployment Triggered**
Since Railway is configured for auto-deployment, your push to GitHub should have automatically triggered a new deployment. Railway will:

1. **Detect Changes**: Automatically detect the new commit
2. **Build Process**: Run the build commands from `nixpacks.toml`
3. **Deploy**: Deploy the updated application

### **Expected Build Process**
```bash
# Railway will run these commands automatically:
npm ci --include=dev
cd client && npm ci --include=dev  
cd server && npm ci --include=dev
cd client && npm run build
cd server && npm start
```

## 🔧 Railway Environment Variables Required

Based on your existing configuration, ensure these variables are set in Railway:

### **Critical Variables** (App won't start without these):
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-change-in-production-abc123xyz789
SUPABASE_URL=https://dswuotsdaltsomyqqykn.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImRzd3VvdHNkYWx0c29teXFxeWtuIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1OTM4MzgyNiwiZXhwIjoyMDc0OTU5ODI2fQ.BVCW6hzW6DCY9NFG-Vc4aiLk470A5_0eCVrfjjUxldw
PORT=${{PORT}}
```

### **Additional Variables** (for full functionality):
```env
VENICE_API_KEY=your-venice-api-key
CORS_ALLOWLIST=https://your-app-name.railway.app
COOKIE_DOMAIN=.railway.app
CSRF_ENABLED=true
```

## 🎯 How to Monitor Deployment

### **Option 1: Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click on your service
4. Check the "Deployments" tab for build status
5. Monitor logs in real-time

### **Option 2: Railway CLI** (if you have access)
```bash
npx @railway/cli login
npx @railway/cli status
npx @railway/cli logs
```

### **Option 3: Check Your App URL**
Once deployed, visit your Railway app URL to test the new features.

## 🧪 Testing the New Features

### **Confession Auto-Sorting Test**
1. **Visit your Railway app**
2. **Navigate to Confessions page**
3. **Look for the toggle button**: "Auto-sort by upvotes"
4. **Test the functionality**:
   - Toggle should show golden highlight when active
   - Confessions should sort by upvotes (highest first)
   - Sorting should update every 10 seconds
   - Vote changes should trigger immediate re-sorting

### **Expected Behavior**
- ✅ **Toggle Button**: Shows current sorting mode
- ✅ **Auto-Sort**: Confessions arrange by upvotes every 10s
- ✅ **Real-Time**: Vote changes trigger immediate sorting
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators of sorting status

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If Deployment Fails**
1. **Check Railway Logs**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set
3. **Check Build Process**: Look for npm install/build errors

### **If App Doesn't Start**
1. **Missing JWT_SECRET**: Most common issue
2. **Supabase Credentials**: Verify URL and service role key
3. **Port Configuration**: Ensure PORT is set to `${{PORT}}`

### **If Features Don't Work**
1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify API Calls**: Ensure `/api/confessions?sortBy=score` works
3. **WebSocket Connection**: Check if real-time updates work
