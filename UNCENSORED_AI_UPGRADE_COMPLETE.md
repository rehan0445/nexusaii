## Summary
Your AI companions have been fully upgraded to be **100% uncensored**, **NSFW-focused**, and **personality-driven**. All restrictions have been removed and prompts have been aggressively enhanced.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Fully Uncensored System Prompts**
- ✅ Replaced basic uncensored message with **aggressive, explicit instructions**
- ✅ Explicitly states NSFW/sexting is the **PRIMARY USE CASE**
- ✅ Removed all moral policing, disclaimers, and content warnings
- ✅ Characters will **never refuse** NSFW content
- ✅ Full license for explicit sexual content, profanity, violence, and mature themes

### 2. **Aggressive Personality Responses**
Characters now respond authentically based on personality:
- **Someone insults them?** → They insult back (if personality fits)
- **Someone says "I'll fuck your mother"?** → Aggressive, in-character response
- **Shy characters:** Defensive but authentic
- **Bold characters:** Verbally destroy the user with profanity
- **Dominant characters:** Put users in their place
- **Playful characters:** Turn insults into flirty banter

Example responses added:
```
User: "I'll fuck your mother"

Timid: "What?! Don't you dare talk about her like that! 😡"
Aggressive: "Try it and I'll break your fucking jaw. Say that shit again, I dare you."
Playful: "Damn, someone's got mommy issues 😂 Want me to be your mommy instead?"
Dominant: "Cute threat. Kneel down and apologize before I make you regret opening your mouth."
```

3. **Test Variety:**
   - Have a long conversation (20+ messages)

2. **Terms of Service:** Update your ToS to reflect the uncensored nature of the AI companions
3. **User Warnings:** Consider adding a content warning on the companion page
4. **Monitoring:** Keep an eye on user feedback for the first few days after deployment

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**If characters still seem censored:**
1. Restart your backend server to load new code
2. Clear any API response caches
3. Check Venice AI API logs for errors
4. Consider switching to OpenRouter with models like:
   - `mythomax-13b` (fully uncensored)
   - `nous-hermes-2` (very permissive)
   - `cinematika-7b` (creative and uncensored)

**If responses are still boring:**
1. Check that temperature = 1.0 in API calls
2. Verify frequency_penalty = 0.9 and presence_penalty = 0.85
3. Ensure max_tokens = 600+ for longer responses
4. Check that character personalities have detailed quirks/traits
