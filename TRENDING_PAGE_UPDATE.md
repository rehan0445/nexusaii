# Trending Page Update - Complete Summary

## Overview
Updated the Character Leaderboard feature to be renamed as "Trending" page with proper view count tracking from the backend database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Renamed "Character Leaderboard" to "Trending"
- **File**: `client/src/components/CharacterLeaderboard.tsx`
  - Changed header title from "Character Leaderboard" to "Trending"
  - Updated empty state messages to reflect "Trending" branding
  - Updated console logs for better debugging

- **File**: `client/src/components/CompactLeaderboard.tsx`
  - Changed component title from "Top Characters" to "Trending"
  - Updated aria labels and empty state messages
  - Made the component fetch data asynchronously from backend

- **File**: `client/src/data/AI-chat-data/data.ts`
  - Updated menu item label from "Leaderboard" to "Trending"

- **File**: `client/src/pages/AiChat.tsx`
  - Updated switch case handler from "Leaderboard" to "Trending"
  - Updated active menu item check to use "Trending" label
  - Updated comments to reflect new naming

### 2. Fixed View Count Tracking
Both leaderboard components now properly fetch real-time view counts from the backend:

- **Backend API**: `/api/v1/views/leaderboard`
  - Fetches character view counts from `character_view_counts` table in Supabase
  - Returns ranked list of characters based on total views
  - Supports limit parameter and ranking type (total/unique)

- **View Tracking Flow**:
  1. When a user views a character, `incrementView()` is called in `viewsManager.ts`
  2. View is tracked in backend via `/api/v1/views/track` endpoint
  3. Backend stores view in `character_views` table
  4. Backend updates aggregated counts in `character_view_counts` table
  5. Leaderboard fetches latest counts when opened

- **Updated Components**:
  - `CharacterLeaderboard.tsx`: Now fetches fresh data every time it opens
  - `CompactLeaderboard.tsx`: Converted to async data fetching with proper error handling

### 3. Hidden "+" Button When Trending Page is Open
- **File**: `client/src/pages/AiChat.tsx`
  - Added conditional rendering: `{!showFullLeaderboard && (...)}` 
  - The floating action button (Create new companion) is now hidden when the Trending page modal is open
  - This prevents UI overlap and improves user experience

## Technical Details

### Database Tables Used
1. **character_views**: Individual view records with user_id, session_id, and timestamp
2. **character_view_counts**: Aggregated counts with total_views, unique_views, and last_viewed_at

### API Endpoints
- **POST** `/api/v1/views/track`: Track a character view
- **GET** `/api/v1/views/leaderboard`: Get ranked characters by view count

### View Deduplication
- Views are deduplicated within 1-hour window per user/session
- Prevents spam and ensures accurate view counts

## Benefits
1. ✅ **Real-time Data**: Leaderboard always shows latest view counts from database
2. ✅ **Better UX**: Cleaner branding with "Trending" instead of "Leaderboard"
3. ✅ **No UI Conflicts**: "+" button hidden when modal is open
4. ✅ **Consistent Naming**: All references updated across the codebase
5. ✅ **Accurate Tracking**: View counts properly tracked and aggregated in backend

## Testing Recommendations
1. Open the Trending page and verify it shows characters ranked by views
2. Click on a character profile to increment view count
3. Re-open Trending page to see updated view counts
4. Verify the "+" button disappears when Trending page is open
5. Check that both CompactLeaderboard and full Trending page show same data

## Files Modified
1. `client/src/components/CharacterLeaderboard.tsx`
2. `client/src/components/CompactLeaderboard.tsx`
3. `client/src/data/AI-chat-data/data.ts`
4. `client/src/pages/AiChat.tsx`

All changes are backward compatible and no breaking changes were introduced.
