# âš¡ Start Your Backend Server - Fixed!

The script has been fixed! Run this command now:

```powershell
.\start-backend-server.ps1
```

## What It Does

1. âœ… Checks if server directory exists
2. âœ… Installs dependencies if needed
3. âœ… Creates .env file if missing
4. âœ… Kills any process using port 8002
5. âœ… Starts backend server on port 8002
6. âœ… Opens server logs in new window

---

## After Running

You should see:
```
[STARTING] Backend Server...
============================================================
[CHECKING] Looking for processes on port 8002...
[STARTING] Starting backend server on port 8002...

[SUCCESS] Backend server is running on port 8002!

Server URLs:
  http://localhost:8002
  http://127.0.0.1:8002

What's Next:
  1. Backend server is running
  2. Refresh your browser
  3. Try chatting with your character
  4. Should work now!
```

## Important: Configure Venice API Key

After the server starts, you MUST add your Venice API key:

1. **Get your key** from: https://venice.ai/settings/api-keys

2. **Edit** `server/.env`:
   ```bash
   VENICE_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
   ```

3. **Restart server** (close server window and run script again)

---

## Quick Test

After server is running:

```powershell
# Test if server responds
curl http://localhost:8002
```

Should return a response (not error)

---

## Alternative: Manual Start

If script still has issues:

```powershell
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Then refresh your browser!

**Run the script now and your character chat will work!** ðŸš€
