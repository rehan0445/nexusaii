# View Tracking Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem Identified
The view tracking system was using a **1-hour deduplication window**, which meant:
- Opening Batman 6 times in quick succession only counted as 1 view
- The system prevented duplicate views from the same user/session within 1 hour
- This made the trending page show inaccurate view counts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Reduced Deduplication Window: 1 Hour → 5 Seconds**
- **File**: `server/controllers/viewsController.js`
- Changed from `60 * 60 * 1000` (1 hour) to `5 * 1000` (5 seconds)
- Now each character visit counts as a new view after just 5 seconds
- Prevents accidental double-clicks but counts real visits

### 2. **Added View Tracking to Character Profile Page**
- **File**: `client/src/pages/CharacterProfile.tsx`
- Added `incrementView()` call when profile page is opened
- Previously only tracked views when entering chat, now tracks profile views too
- Uses the same backend tracking system

### 3. **Enhanced Logging for Debugging**
- Added detailed console logs in backend:
  - ✅ "Recording new view" when a view is counted
  - 🔍 "Duplicate check" showing whether view is new or duplicate
  - 📊 "Updated aggregated counts" when counts are refreshed
  - ⏭️ "Skipping duplicate" when within 5-second window

## How It Works Now

### View Tracking Flow:
1. **User opens character** (profile or chat page)
2. **Frontend calls** `incrementView(characterId)`
3. **Backend checks** if same user/session viewed this character in last 5 seconds
4. **If NEW (>5 sec)**: 
   - Insert record into `character_views` table
   - Update aggregated counts in `character_view_counts` table
   - Return updated count
5. **If DUPLICATE (<5 sec)**:
   - Skip insertion
   - Return current count
   - Log "DUPLICATE (within 5 sec)"

### Deduplication Logic:
- **Authenticated users**: Checked by `user_id` + `character_id` + time window
- **Anonymous users**: Checked by `session_id` + `character_id` + time window
- **Time window**: 5 seconds (prevents double-clicks, counts real visits)

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `server/controllers/viewsController.js` - Reduced deduplication to 5 seconds
2. ✅ `client/src/pages/CharacterProfile.tsx` - Added view tracking on profile open

## Testing

### Test the Fix:
1. **Open Batman's profile/chat** → View count: 1
2. **Wait 6+ seconds**
3. **Open Batman again** → View count: 2
4. **Open Batman 5 more times** (waiting 6 sec each) → View count: 7
5. **Check Trending page** → Should show updated count

### Using the Test Script:
```bash
node test-view-tracking.js
```

This will:
- Track a view (should count)
- Track immediate duplicate (should skip)
- Track after 2 seconds (should skip)
- Track with different session (should count)
- Show final leaderboard

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Each real character visit counts after 5 seconds
- ✅ Accidental double-clicks within 5 seconds are ignored
- ✅ Trending page shows accurate, real-time view counts
- ✅ Both profile and chat page visits are tracked
- ✅ Different sessions count as separate views

## Console Output Examples

### When a view is counted:
```
🔍 Duplicate check for session abc123 on character batman-bruce-wayne: NEW VIEW
✅ Recording new view for character batman-bruce-wayne
📊 Updated aggregated counts for character batman-bruce-wayne
```

### When a duplicate is skipped:
```
🔍 Duplicate check for session abc123 on character batman-bruce-wayne: DUPLICATE (within 5 sec)
⏭️ Skipping duplicate view for character batman-bruce-wayne
```

## Benefits
1. ✅ **Accurate View Counts**: Each visit properly tracked
2. ✅ **Fast Updates**: 5-second window allows quick re-visits to count
3. ✅ **No Spam**: Prevents accidental double-clicks
4. ✅ **Better Debugging**: Detailed logs show what's happening
5. ✅ **Real-time Trending**: Leaderboard reflects actual popularity

## Note
The 5-second window is perfect for:
- Counting real user visits
- Preventing accidental double-clicks
- Allowing users to revisit characters and have it count
- Maintaining accurate trending data

If you want to count EVERY single click (even accidental), you can set it to 0 seconds or remove the check entirely, but 5 seconds is recommended for accurate, spam-free tracking.
