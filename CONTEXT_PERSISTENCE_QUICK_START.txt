  COMPANION CONTEXT PERSISTENCE - QUICK START GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎉 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

Your companions now remember conversations across sessions using:
• SessionStorage (short-term, fast access)
• Supabase (long-term, persistent across devices)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 DEPLOYMENT (3 STEPS):

1️⃣  RUN DATABASE MIGRATION
   
   Option A: Using Supabase CLI
   cd server
   npx supabase migration run
   
   Option B: Manual (Supabase Dashboard)
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Paste contents of: server/scripts/migrations/005_companion_context.sql
   - Click "Run"
   - Verify "companion_context" table created

2️⃣  RESTART BACKEND SERVER
   
   cd server
   npm run dev
   
   ✓ Verify: "Server is running" message appears
   ✓ Verify: No errors in console

3️⃣  RESTART FRONTEND
   
   cd client
   npm run dev
   
   ✓ Verify: App opens without errors
   ✓ Verify: Can access companion chat

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧪 TESTING (Verify Everything Works):

1. Open any companion character chat
2. Send 3-4 messages
3. Check browser console for:
   ✓ "✅ Context loaded and cached"
   ✓ "📊 Context sync: X messages"
   ✓ "✅ Context synced to Supabase"

4. Refresh the page (F5)
   ✓ Context should load from sessionStorage instantly
   ✓ Previous messages should still be there
   ✓ AI should remember conversation

5. Close tab completely, reopen chat
   ✓ Context should load from Supabase
   ✓ Previous messages restored
   ✓ AI still remembers you

6. Click "⋮" menu → "Start New Chat"
   ✓ Confirm dialog appears
   ✓ Messages cleared
   ✓ Fresh context created
   ✓ AI forgets previous conversation

7. Enable Incognito Mode
   ✓ Chat, refresh → memory should NOT persist
   ✓ Each session is fresh

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✨ NEW FEATURES YOU NOW HAVE:

✓ Companions remember:
  - Your relationship status (just met → friends → close)
  - Personal facts you share (location, age, hobbies)
  - Conversation tone (friendly, romantic, playful)
  - Key events and moments
  - Your preferences (nickname, topics to avoid)

✓ Automatic summarization:
  - After 20 messages OR 5000 characters
  - Keeps context lightweight
  - Uses AI to summarize conversation

✓ Smart memory merging:
  - Base character traits from animeCharacters.ts
  - PLUS persistent memory from Supabase
  - Seamless integration

✓ "Start New Chat" button:
  - In chat menu (⋮ → Start New Chat)
  - Resets context completely
  - Keeps base character personality

✓ Graceful fallbacks:
  - If Supabase fails → uses sessionStorage
  - If sessionStorage fails → uses base context
  - No breaking errors, always works

🔍 WHERE TO FIND THINGS:

Backend Files:
├─ server/scripts/migrations/005_companion_context.sql (Database)
├─ server/services/companionContextService.js (Logic)
├─ server/routes/companionContext.js (API)
└─ server/controllers/chatAiController.js (AI Integration)

Frontend Files:
├─ client/src/utils/companionMemory.ts (SessionStorage)
├─ client/src/utils/contextExtractor.ts (Memory Extraction)
└─ client/src/pages/CharacterChat.tsx (UI Integration)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❓ TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem: "companion_context table doesn't exist"
→ Solution: Run migration (Step 1 above)

Problem: "Context not saving"
→ Check: Browser console for errors
→ Check: Supabase dashboard → Authentication (user logged in?)
→ Check: Network tab → /context/save should return 200

Problem: "AI doesn't remember conversations"
→ Check: persistentContext being sent in AI request?
→ Check: Browser console → "📝 PERSISTENT MEMORY" in logs?

Problem: "Refresh loses context"
→ Check: SessionStorage available? (Private browsing disables it)
→ Check: Supabase load returning data?

Problem: "Start New Chat doesn't reset"
→ Check: /context/reset API returning success?
→ Check: Browser console for errors?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 HOW IT WORKS (Technical Overview):

User Opens Chat:
→ Check sessionStorage (instant)
→ If not found, load from Supabase
→ Merge with base character
→ Cache in sessionStorage

User Sends Message:
→ Include persistent memory in AI request
→ AI responds with context awareness
→ Extract memory updates from conversation
→ Update sessionStorage (instant)
→ Sync to Supabase (async, non-blocking)
→ Auto-summarize if threshold reached

User Refreshes:
→ Load from sessionStorage (< 1ms)
→ If expired/missing, load from Supabase
→ Context fully restored

User Starts New Chat:
→ Delete from Supabase
→ Clear sessionStorage
→ Create fresh base context
→ Clean slate

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

NORMAL MODE:
✓ First chat → Fresh context
✓ Subsequent messages → Memory builds
✓ Refresh → Context persists
✓ Logout/login → Context persists
✓ Different device → Context syncs (via Supabase)

INCOGNITO MODE:
✓ Every session → Fresh start
✓ Refresh → Memory lost
✓ No Supabase sync
✓ Complete privacy

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 PRO TIPS:

1. Monitor browser console during testing
   - All context operations are logged
   - Errors show up with ❌ prefix
   - Success shows ✅ prefix

2. Use Supabase Dashboard to inspect data
   - Table: companion_context
   - View saved memories, summaries, etc.

3. Test edge cases:
   - Offline mode (should use cached context)
   - Multiple tabs (should stay in sync)
   - Long conversations (auto-summarization)

4. Customize extraction patterns:
   - Edit client/src/utils/contextExtractor.ts
   - Add new fact patterns, tones, events

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ YOU'RE ALL SET!

The companion context persistence system is fully implemented and ready to use.

Enjoy natural, continuous conversations with your companions! 🎉
