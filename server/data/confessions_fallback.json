I'm socially active, having buzzing social media, act to be really funny and kind to others and everything. Have a pretty standard family life and posh style, I'm that girl that juniors wanna be. I'm creative,funny,smart.\n\nBut what people irl around me never realise or even can imagine is that I'm a fucking horny monster. For as long as I can remember I've been craving sex. I've never dated because I'm not sure how to do the relationship thing. But ohmy god I'm so horny,I literally sext loads of men in this throwaway account fantasizing about sucking them and choking.I talk to strangers on omegle and vc them,watch them jacking off and cuming for me I talk about fucking and show my tits(never my face). I imagine doing dirty things to my crush but can't even speak to him. Nobody knows I watch so much porn and fantasize about being bound and bend and railed. I fantasize about being rough fucked and used by older men one by one in a group,\n\nwhile keeping up this vanilla girl act.\n\nUghhh it's so good to get this off my chest.",

      "content": "Please don't judge me guys 🙏 \n\nAfter diploma, I transferred to sy and quickly became acquainted with the neighbour in my dorm, a girl who was a design student. She lived in a 1rk. Despite the rumors circulating among the guys about her offering handjobs for 500 & bj for 3k, I initially ignored them. \n\nShe seemed dedicated to her studies, often found in the library, and didn't socialize much, which didn't fit the stereotype of someone engaging in such activities. However, as the semester progressed, I started to notice that guys frequently visited her room, which piqued my curiosity.\n\nIt was the last week of the sem-4, and with  upcoming OS exam, I was feeling the stress. One of my stress reactions is becoming quite horny. The rumors about the her kept playing in my mind, so I decided to test their validity. I then made up a question about OS and knocked on her door. After she explained it, she asked if there was anything else I needed. When she said, \"Anything at all?\" I hesitated, but she seemed to understand my hesitation. \"You brought money?\" she asked, and I nodded. She tapped her desk, and I laid the money out so she could count it. I sat in her chair, and she removed her tshirt. The rumors were true. She used tissues to cover the head of my cock when I finished. What started as a one-time thing turned into a recurring scenario, with me visiting her about four times in last 3 months.",

      "content": "I want to share something that happened in my college a while back. I’m not mentioning the name of the institution, but I still can’t forget something that happened last year when I was a fresher. I won’t name the college, but it’s a very reputed institution where most students are JEE Advanced qualified so naturally, people expect discipline, maturity, and a higher standard of behavior.\n\nOur college is known to be strict about ragging. Because of repeated past issues (mostly involving boys), the anti-ragging monitoring period was extended from 28 days to 4 months. Even then, things went wrong.\n\nThis time, it wasn’t the boys it was senior girls. Many freshers, especially girls, refused to address seniors as ma’am or sir (which is actually a rule here). The seniors felt disrespected. To make things worse, some senior boys were giving a lot of attention to just a few freshers, which created jealousy and ego clashes among the senior girls.\n\nOnce the official anti-ragging period ended, a group of senior girls called the fresher girls into the bathroom (since there were no CCTVs) and forced them into humiliating acts. They made them dance on the commode and bring food from the night canteen. one of my friends, who was close with the seniors, was actually the one sharing the freshers’ numbers.\n\nThe juniors were devastated. Many cried a lot, and the case eventually reached the higher authorities. Some seniors were about to be debarred for 28 days, but certain professors stepped in and prevented strict punishment. After this, the fresher girls’ group completely broke apart, and their mental health was badly affected.\n\nIt’s been a year, but this incident still stays in my mind. At first, I thought ragging was just a tradition or a bonding exercise, but witnessing this changed my perspective. Even in a place filled with JEE Advanced qualified students, ego and power games can create lasting scars.\n\nBAHUT KUCH HUA THA BATHROOM MEIN CANT TELL NATIONAL ISSUE BAN JAYEGA BUT MAYBE I HOPE ITS AN RUMOUR BUT DEEP DOWN I KNOW WHAT IT IS\n\nSO JUST READ IT AND FORGET IT",
