# 🎯 Debug Monitor - Super Simple Guide

## 📍 **What is the Debug Monitor?**

Imagine you're watching a football game on TV, and there's a **scoreboard** showing:
- ⚽ Goals scored
- 🏃 Players running
- ⏰ Time remaining

The **Debug Monitor** is like that scoreboard, but for your app! It shows:
- 📨 How many messages you have
- 📞 How many times the app asked the server for messages
- 🚨 When messages disappear (the bug!)

---

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step (Like Following a Recipe)**

### **Ingredient 1: The Debug Monitor File**
- Location: `D:\nexus_rehan\aadrika\test-message-disappearing-debug.html`
- Think of it as: A special webpage that watches your app

### **Ingredient 2: Your App**
- Location: `http://localhost:5173` (when running)
- Think of it as: The main dish we're cooking

---

## 👉 **How to Use (3 Simple Steps)**

### **STEP 1: Open the Watcher (Debug Monitor)**

**Windows Explorer Way (Easiest):**
1. Press `Windows Key + E` (opens File Explorer)
2. Type or paste in address bar:
   ```
   D:\nexus_rehan\aadrika
   ```
3. Find file: `test-message-disappearing-debug.html`
4. **Double-click it**
5. It opens in your browser! ✅

You'll see a **black screen with green text** - that's perfect!

---

### **STEP 2: Open Your App (The Thing We're Watching)**

**In a NEW browser tab:**
1. Make sure your app is running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open: `http://localhost:5173`
3. Log in (if not already)
4. Go to **Hangout section**

Now you have **2 tabs open**:
- Tab 1: Debug Monitor (black/green screen)
- Tab 2: Your App

---

### **STEP 3: Arrange Side-by-Side (So You See Both)**

**Easy Way:**
1. Click on **your app tab**
2. Press `Windows Key + Left Arrow` → App goes to left half ⬅️
3. Click on **debug monitor tab**  
4. Press `Windows Key + Right Arrow` → Monitor goes to right half ➡️

Now you see both at once!

```

│  Message 1          │  │  Logs...            │
│  Message 2          │  │                     │
└─────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘
```

## 🎬 **What to Do Next**

### **Test 1: Just Look at a Room**

**In your app (left side):**
1. Click on any Hangout room
2. Wait for messages to load

**Watch the debug monitor (right side):**
- Numbers will start changing!
- Logs will appear!

**What you're looking for:**
- Do messages appear in your app?
- Do they disappear after a few seconds?
- Watch the **"Context Message Count"** number:
  - Does it go from 5 → 0? (BUG!)
  - Does it stay at 5? (GOOD!)

---

### **Test 2: Send a Message**

**In your app:**
1. Type a message
2. Send it

**Watch the debug monitor:**
- "API Calls" should increase
- "State Updates" should increase
- Your message should stay visible

**If your message disappears:**
- Look for red text in logs saying "MESSAGES CLEARED"
- Click **"Export Logs"** button
- A file downloads - save it!

---

## 📊 **Understanding the Numbers (Metrics)**

### **Context Message Count**
- **What it is:** How many messages the app *thinks* it has
- **Good:** Stays at 5 (or whatever number)
- **Bad:** Goes from 5 → 0 (messages disappearing!)

### **Local Message Count**
- **What it is:** How many messages are shown on screen
- **Good:** Matches Context Count
- **Bad:** Different from Context Count

### **API Calls Made**
- **What it is:** How many times app asked server for messages
- **Good:** 1-2 calls
- **Bad:** 5+ calls (too many, causing issues!)

### **State Updates**
- **What it is:** How many times message list changed
- **Good:** 1-2 updates
- **Bad:** 5+ updates (something's wrong!)

### **Messages Cleared Count**
- **What it is:** How many times messages were deleted
- **Good:** 0 (never cleared)
- **Bad:** 1+ (this is the bug!)

---

## 🚨 **When You See the Bug**

**If messages disappear:**

1. **Don't panic!** This is what we want to see
2. Look at the debug monitor
3. Click **"Export Logs"** button (green button)
4. A file downloads: `message-debug-logs-[numbers].json`
5. Save that file

**Then tell me:**
- "Messages appeared then disappeared after X seconds"
- "Context Count went from 5 to 0"
- "Here's the log file" (attach it)

## ❓ **Common Questions**

### **Q: I don't see the debug monitor file**
**A:** Make sure you're looking in: `D:\nexus_rehan\aadrika`
It's in the **main project folder**, not inside `client` or `server`

### **Q: The debug monitor is blank/nothing happens**
**A:** That's normal! It only shows logs when you:
1. Navigate to a Hangout room
2. Send messages
3. Do things in the app
It's waiting for action!

### **Q: Too many logs, can't read them**
**A:** Don't worry! You don't need to read every log.
Just watch the **numbers** (metrics) at the top.
If "Messages Cleared" goes above 0, that's the bug!

### **Q: The numbers are changing too fast**
**A:** Perfect! That means it's working.
When you see the bug (messages disappear), click "Export Logs" immediately.

### **Q: What if I can't create a room to test?**
**A:** See the file `FIX_ROOM_CREATION_FIRST.md` 
We can create test data directly in the database!

## ✅ **Success Checklist**

Before you start:
- [ ] Backend server is running (`npm start` in server folder)
- [ ] Frontend app is running (`npm run dev` in main folder)
- [ ] You're logged in to the app
- [ ] You have at least one Hangout room to test with

Ready to test:
- [ ] Debug monitor is open in one tab
- [ ] Your app is open in another tab
- [ ] Both are visible side-by-side

During test:
- [ ] Navigate to Hangout room
- [ ] Watch the numbers change
- [ ] Send a test message
- [ ] If bug happens, export logs

---

## 🎯 **The Goal**

We want to see **WHEN and WHY** messages disappear.

The debug monitor will show us:
- **WHEN:** Exact timestamp when it happens
- **WHY:** Which part of the code caused it (stack trace)

With this information, I can fix the bug permanently! 🎉

---

## 💡 **Super Quick Version**

If you just want the fastest way:

1. **Double-click** `test-message-disappearing-debug.html`
2. **Open your app** in new tab
3. **Go to Hangout**, click a room
4. **Watch both screens**
5. **If bug happens**, click "Export Logs"
6. **Send me the log file**

That's it! 🚀
