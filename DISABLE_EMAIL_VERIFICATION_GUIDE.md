## Step 1: Disable Email Confirmation in Supabase Dashboard

### Instructions:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://app.supabase.com
   - Login to your account
   - Select your Nexus project

2. **Navigate to Authentication Settings**
   - Click **Authentication** in the left sidebar
   - Click **Providers** at the top
   - Scroll down to find **Email** provider

3. **Disable Email Confirmation**
   - Click on **Email** provider to expand settings
   - Find the toggle for **"Confirm email"**
   - **Turn OFF** the "Confirm email" toggle
   - Click **Save** at the bottom

4. **Verify Settings**
   - The setting should now show: "Confirm email: Disabled"
   - Users will now get instant access without email verification

## Step 2: Verify Existing Unverified Users

Run the script to automatically verify all existing unverified users:

```bash
node verify-existing-users.js
```

This script will:
- Find all users with `email_confirmed_at = null`
- Update them to be verified
- Give them immediate access

## Step 3: Test Registration Flow

1. **Open your app** (development or production)
2. **Navigate to Register page**
3. **Enter details:**
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: test123456
4. **Click "Create Account"**
5. **Expected Result:**
   - No email modal appears
   - User is immediately logged in
   - User is redirected to `/companion` page
   - Can access all features immediately
