# ✅ College Names, Images & Dark Room Navigation - Fixed

## 🎓 **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **IICT → IIST** ✅

**Changed:**
- **Old Name:** IICT (International Institute of Computer Technology)
- **New Name:** IIST (International Institute of Space Technology)
- **New Image:** https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f4/b6/fe/f4b6fe3e6d0af5f2b3930c4ed17e4dd8.jpg

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `CollegeSelection.tsx` - College card
- ✅ `CollegeCampus.tsx` - Campus header
- ✅ `CollegeInfoWrapper.tsx` - Info page
- ✅ `CollegeConfessionWrapper.tsx` - Confession page
- ✅ `ConfessionPage.tsx` - Campus code mapping
- ✅ `ConfessionDetailPage.tsx` - Campus code mapping (4 occurrences)
- ✅ `EnhancedAnnouncementsPage.tsx` - Campus code mapping

**ID Changed:**
- `iict` → `iist` (lowercase ID for routes)

### 2. **Parul University Image Updated** ✅

**New Image:** https://i.pinimg.com/736x/40/b7/bd/40b7bddc3c79546f2d19da84f4ef6b42.jpg

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `CollegeSelection.tsx` - College card image
- ✅ `CollegeCampus.tsx` - Campus header image

---

### 3. **Dark Room Back Navigation Fixed** ✅

**Problem:**
- Clicking back button in Dark Room chat was navigating to Campus
- Should stay within Dark Room and go back to Dark Room list

**Root Cause:**
- Browser history navigation was overriding React state navigation
- Back button was using browser's `history.back()` instead of React callback

**Solution:**
Added `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` to back button in `AnonymousChat.tsx`:

```tsx
// Before (browser navigation):
<button onClick={onBack}>
  <ArrowLeft />
</button>

// After (React state navigation only):
<button onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  onBack();
}}>
  <ArrowLeft />
</button>
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Back button now stays within Dark Room interface
- ✅ Returns to Dark Room list showing all available rooms
- ✅ No longer navigates back to Campus

## 📊 **Before vs After:**

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| **College Name** | IICT | IIST ✅ |
| **Full Name** | International Institute of Computer Technology | International Institute of Space Technology ✅ |
| **IIST Image** | Generic placeholder | Space-themed campus image ✅ |
| **Parul Image** | Old placeholder | Updated campus image ✅ |
| **Dark Room Back** | Goes to Campus ❌ | Stays in Dark Room list ✅ |

## 🔧 **Technical Details:**

### **College ID Mapping:**
```javascript
// Updated campus code mapping:
'IIST': 'iist'  // (changed from 'IICT': 'iict')
```

### **Image URLs:**
```javascript
// IIST
image: 'https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f4/b6/fe/f4b6fe3e6d0af5f2b3930c4ed17e4dd8.jpg'

// Parul University
image: 'https://i.pinimg.com/736x/40/b7/bd/40b7bddc3c79546f2d19da84f4ef6b42.jpg'
```

### **Navigation Fix:**
The back button now explicitly prevents browser navigation and only uses React state management:
- `e.preventDefault()` - Stops browser default back action
- `e.stopPropagation()` - Prevents event bubbling
- `onBack()` - Calls React callback to update state

---

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps:**

1. ⏳ Wait 2-3 minutes for Railway build & deployment
2. 🔄 Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. ✅ Test IIST college (name, image, navigation)
4. ✅ Test Parul University (image)
5. ✅ Test Dark Room back button (stays in Dark Room)

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

### **College Selection:**
- All campuses still work with their existing data
- Only IIST name and images were updated
- Campus codes in database remain unchanged

### **Dark Room Navigation:**
The navigation flow is now:
```
Campus → Dark Room Tab → Dark Room List → Dark Room Chat
                    ↑_______________|
                    (back button)
```

Previously it was incorrectly going:
```
Campus → Dark Room Tab → Dark Room List → Dark Room Chat
   ↑_______________________________________________|
   (back button - WRONG!)
```
