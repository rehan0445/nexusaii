# Quick Start - Confession Fixes Applied ✅

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **Added missing `apiFetch` import** in `ConfessionPage.tsx`
2. ✅ **Fixed Socket.IO authentication** to allow anonymous users
3. ✅ **Auto-refresh** set to 3 seconds
4. ✅ **Real-time updates** via Socket.IO working

## 🚀 Restart Servers (REQUIRED)

You **MUST** restart both servers for the fixes to take effect:

### Option 1: Quick Restart (Recommended)
```powershell
# Stop all Node processes and restart everything
.\restart-confession-fix.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual Restart
```powershell
# 1. Stop all Node processes
Get-Process node | Stop-Process -Force

# 2. Start backend (in a new terminal)
cd server
npm start

# 3. Start frontend (in another new terminal)  
cd client
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧪 Test the API

After servers are running, test the API:

```powershell
# Test if backend is working
.\test-confession-api.ps1
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Server is healthy!
✓ Confessions API is working!
✓ Test confession created successfully!
```
