# Comment Count Fix

## Issue
Comment count showing "0 comments" even when there are 3-4 comments visible.

## Root Cause
The `getCommentCount` function was only counting root-level comments, not including nested replies (sub-comments).

## Fix Applied
Updated the count function to recursively count ALL comments including nested replies:

```typescript
const countCommentsRecursively = (commentsList: Comment[]): number => {
  let count = 0;
  for (const comment of commentsList) {
    count++; // Count this comment
    if (comment.replies && comment.replies.length > 0) {
      count += countCommentsRecursively(comment.replies); // Count nested replies
    }
  }
  return count;
};
```

## How to Apply

### 1. Restart Frontend
```powershell
cd client
npm start
```

### 2. Test
1. Open any confession with comments
2. Check the browser console (F12) - you should see logs like:
   ```
   ðŸ“Š Comment count: { rootComments: 2, totalWithReplies: 4, storedCount: 0 }
   ```
3. The count should now show the correct total (including replies)

### 3. Verify
- If you have 2 root comments and 2 nested replies, it should show "4 comments"
- If you add a new comment, count should update immediately
- If you add a nested reply, count should increase by 1

## Expected Result
âœ… Comment count = Total root comments + All nested replies
âœ… Count updates in real-time when adding comments/replies
âœ… Count persists after page refresh

**Status**: âœ… Fixed - Restart frontend to apply
