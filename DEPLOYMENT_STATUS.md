### ⚠️ Critical: Update Supabase Redirect URLs

Before testing, you **MUST** add these to Supabase:

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com → Your Project
2. Navigate to: **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
3. Add to **Redirect URLs**:

```
# Production (Railway)
https://your-railway-app.railway.app/companion
https://your-railway-app.railway.app

# Local Development
http://localhost:5173/companion
http://localhost:5173
```

**Replace** `your-railway-app.railway.app` with your actual Railway domain!

### How to Find Your Railway URL:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Select your Nexus project
3. Click on your service
4. Look for **Domains** section
5. Copy your `.railway.app` URL

## 🔍 Monitor Deployment

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Invalid redirect URL"
**Cause**: Railway URL not added to Supabase
**Fix**: Add Railway domain to Supabase redirect URLs (see above)

### Issue: Build fails on Railway
**Cause**: Dependencies or build errors
**Fix**: Check Railway logs for specific error

### Issue: Google button doesn't appear
**Cause**: Build not deployed yet OR browser cache
**Fix**: Wait for deployment OR hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### Issue: "OAuth provider not configured"
**Cause**: Google OAuth not enabled in Supabase
**Fix**: Enable Google in Supabase Authentication → Providers

## 🎯 Next Steps (After Deployment)

1. ✅ **Verify deployment** - Check Railway status
