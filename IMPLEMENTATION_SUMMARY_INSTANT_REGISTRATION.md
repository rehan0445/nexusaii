## 📝 What Was Changed

### 1. Frontend Updates

#### `client/src/pages/Register.tsx`
**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced registration flow with detailed logging
- Added comments explaining email verification disabled

**Key Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Register user with Supabase Auth
// Note: Email verification is disabled in Supabase dashboard
// Users will get instant access without needing to verify email
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({...});

// With email verification disabled, session is created immediately
if (data.session) {
  // User is automatically logged in - redirect to companion page
  console.log('✅ Session created automatically');
  localStorage.setItem('hasSeenOnboarding', 'true');
  localStorage.setItem('hasCompletedOnboarding', 'true');
  navigate("/companion", { replace: true });
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Flow

```
User Registration Flow (Before):
1. User fills registration form
2. Supabase creates user (unverified)
3. Email sent with verification link
4. User clicks link
5. User verified and can login
❌ Breaks at step 3 due to SMTP limit

User Registration Flow (After):
1. User fills registration form
2. Supabase creates user (auto-verified)
3. Session created immediately
4. User redirected to /companion
5. User has instant access
✅ Works perfectly, no email needed
```

### Key Features

1. **Instant Access**
   - No waiting for email
   - Immediate session creation
   - Direct redirect to companion page

2. **Backward Compatible**
   - Code handles both scenarios
   - Easy to re-enable verification
   - No breaking changes

3. **User Experience**
   - Seamless onboarding
   - No confusing email steps
   - Faster time-to-value

4. **Existing Users**
   - Script verifies all pending users
   - They can now login immediately
   - No data loss
