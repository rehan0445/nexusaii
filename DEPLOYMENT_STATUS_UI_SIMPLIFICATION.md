## 🚀 Railway Deployment Status

### **Auto-Deployment Triggered**
Since Railway is configured for auto-deployment, your push to GitHub has automatically triggered a new deployment. Railway will:

1. **Detect Changes**: Automatically detect the new commit
2. **Build Process**: Run the build commands from `nixpacks.toml`
3. **Deploy**: Deploy the updated application with simplified UI

### **Expected Build Process**
```bash
# Railway will run these commands automatically:
npm ci --include=dev
cd client && npm ci --include=dev  
cd server && npm ci --include=dev
cd client && npm run build
cd server && npm start
```
