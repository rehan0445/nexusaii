# Dark Room Fix - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The Dark Room group chats were showing **0 members** for all groups even though users could join successfully. This has been **completely fixed** with:

1. **Real-time user count updates** - Counts now update instantly when users join/leave
2. **Automatic cleanup** - Stale user sessions are cleaned up every 5 minutes
3. **Periodic UI refresh** - User counts refresh every 30 seconds
4. **Better socket handling** - Improved event listeners and state management

## 🚀 How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Use Your Main App

1. **Start the servers** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the client**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Dark Room**:
   - Open the app in your browser
   - Navigate to Arena → Dark Room
   - Set your alias and enter Dark Room
   - **You should now see correct member counts** for all groups!

### Option 2: Use the Test Page

1. **Start the server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open the test page**:
   - Open `test-darkroom-fix.html` in your browser
   - Or visit: `file:///path/to/test-darkroom-fix.html`

3. **Test the functionality**:
   - Enter an alias and click "Connect to Dark Room"
   - Check that existing rooms show their user counts
   - Create a new room
   - Open in multiple browser windows/tabs
   - Join the same room from different windows
   - **Watch the user counts update in real-time!**

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### When viewing rooms:
- ✅ All rooms show accurate member counts
- ✅ Empty rooms show "0 members"
- ✅ Rooms with users show correct count (1, 2, 3, etc.)

### When joining a room:
- ✅ Your browser shows "Joining room..."
- ✅ User count increases by 1
- ✅ Other users in the room see the count update
- ✅ Socket confirms join with correct count

### When leaving a room:
- ✅ User count decreases by 1
- ✅ Other users see the updated count
- ✅ Browser console shows disconnect event

### Automatic cleanup:
- ✅ Every 5 minutes, inactive users are removed
- ✅ User counts automatically adjust
- ✅ Server logs show cleanup activity

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Browser Console

Open Developer Tools (F12) and look for these messages:

**Good signs:**
```
✅ Groups updated from API: [...] 
👥 User count update received: {roomId: "ren-1", count: 2}
✅ Room joined confirmation: {...}
🔄 [DarkRoomTab] Periodic refresh of groups...
```

**Problem indicators:**
```
❌ Failed to fetch groups from API
❌ Socket connection error
❌ User count update received but not applied
```

### Check Server Logs

In your server terminal, look for:

**Good signs:**
```
👥 User joined Dark Room: ren-1 (2 users)
📡 Broadcasting to room ren-1 (2 sockets)
🧹 [Dark Room] Running periodic cleanup...
🔌 Client disconnected: <socket-id>
```

**Problem indicators:**
```
❌ Error adding user to room
❌ Error updating room user count
⚠️ No sockets found in room
```

### Verify Database

Run this SQL to check actual counts:

```sql
SELECT 
  r.id, 
  r.name, 
  r.user_count as stored_count,
  COUNT(ru.id) as actual_active_users
FROM darkroom_rooms r
LEFT JOIN darkroom_room_users ru ON ru.room_id = r.id
GROUP BY r.id, r.name, r.user_count
ORDER BY r.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still showing 0 members

**Solution:**
1. Check that server is running on port 8002
2. Check browser console for API errors
3. Verify Supabase connection in server logs
4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Counts don't update in real-time

**Solution:**
1. Check WebSocket connection (F12 → Network → WS tab)
2. Verify socket.io is connecting successfully
3. Check for firewall/proxy blocking WebSocket
4. Look for socket connection errors in browser console

### Issue: Counts increase but never decrease

**Solution:**
1. Wait 5 minutes for automatic cleanup
2. Check server logs for disconnect events
3. Verify cleanup is running (look for "Running periodic cleanup")

### Issue: Different users see different counts

**Solution:**
1. Wait 30 seconds for automatic refresh
2. Both users should manually refresh their browsers
3. Check that both are connected to the same server
4. Verify socket events are being broadcast
