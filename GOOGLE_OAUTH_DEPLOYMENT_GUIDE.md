## 🔧 Required Supabase Configuration

Before testing, you **MUST** configure the redirect URLs in Supabase:

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
- Navigate to: https://app.supabase.com
- Select your Nexus project
- Go to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**

### 2. Add Redirect URLs

Add these URLs to **Redirect URLs** (Site URL section):

**For Local Development:**
```
http://localhost:5173/companion
http://localhost:5173
```

**For Railway Production:**
```
https://your-railway-app.railway.app/companion
https://your-railway-app.railway.app
```

### 3. Configure Google OAuth Provider

Go to **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Google**:

1. ✅ **Enable** the Google provider (you mentioned you already did this)
2. Verify your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are set
3. Make sure **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console include:
   ```
   https://[YOUR-SUPABASE-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```

## 🚂 Railway Deployment

### Automatic Deployment

Railway is likely configured to **auto-deploy** from your GitHub repository. Here's what happens:

1. ✅ **Code pushed to GitHub** - Done!
2. 🔄 **Railway detects changes** - Automatic
3. 🏗️ **Railway builds your app** - Automatic
4. 🚀 **Railway deploys to production** - Automatic

### Check Deployment Status

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Select your Nexus project
3. Click on your service (probably called "nexus" or similar)
4. Check the **Deployments** tab to see the build progress

### Environment Variables (Important!)

Make sure these are set in Railway:

**Client Environment Variables:**
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

These should already be set from your previous deployment.

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### 1. Test Locally First

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Then visit:
- `http://localhost:5173/login` - Click "Continue with Google"
- `http://localhost:5173/register` - Click "Continue with Google"

### 2. Test on Railway

Once Railway finishes deploying:
1. Visit your Railway URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
2. Navigate to `/login` or `/register`
3. Click **"Continue with Google"**
4. You should be redirected to Google's login page
5. After signing in with Google, you'll be redirected back to `/companion`

### Issue: "Google OAuth not working"
**Fix:** Verify Google OAuth is enabled in Supabase and credentials are correct

### Issue: "Redirects to wrong page"
**Fix:** Check that `redirectTo` URL matches your Railway domain

### Issue: Railway deployment failed
**Fix:** Check Railway logs in the dashboard for build errors
