# Interactive Character Experience - Quick Start Guide 🚀

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Core Features Working NOW:
1. ❤️ **Affection System** - Heart meter (1-5) with 5 tiers
2. 🎮 **Mini-Games** - Riddles, Trivia, Word Games, Quizzes
3. 🧠 **Dynamic Memory** - "Hey Ren! Remember you said..."
4. ⌨️ **Typing Indicator** - Realistic "texting..." delays
5. 📝 **Letter-by-Letter** - Character-by-character message reveal
6. 🎉 **Level-Up Animation** - Confetti celebration on tier increase
7. 🔔 **Sound System** - Notification sounds (when audio files added)
8. 💭 **Contextual Greetings** - Personalized welcome-back messages

## 🔧 Setup Required

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# From project root
cd server
node scripts/run_migrations.js
```
Or manually run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy contents of server/scripts/migrations/016_interactive_features.sql
```

### 2. Add Sound Files (Optional)
Place in `client/public/sounds/`:
- `message.mp3` - New message notification
- `levelup.mp3` - Affection level-up
- `quest.mp3` - Quest completion  
- `quest-start.mp3` - New quest appears

*See `/client/public/sounds/README.md` for specifications*

### 3. Restart Servers
```powershell
# PowerShell
.\restart-all.ps1

# Or manually
cd server && npm run dev
cd client && npm run dev
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Affection Tiers
| Tier | Name | Points | Color | Description |
|------|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Acquaintance | 0-99 | Gray | Just met |
| 2 | Friend | 100-299 | Blue | Getting closer |
| 3 | Close Friend | 300-599 | Purple | Strong bond |
| 4 | Best Friend | 600-899 | Pink | Deep connection |
| 5 | Soulmate | 900-1000 | Gold | Maximum affection |

### Gaining Affection
- Each message: +1 point
- Quest complete: +3 to +8 (difficulty-based)
- Quest attempt: +1 to +2
- Daily check-in: +3
- Returning after 24h: +5

### Quest Types
1. **Riddles** - Logic puzzles
2. **Trivia** - General knowledge
3. **Word Games** - Unscramble, wordplay
4. **Personality Quiz** - Get to know you questions

### Memory Extraction
AI automatically remembers:
- Your name ("My name is...")
- Interests ("I love/like...")
- Emotions ("I'm feeling...")
- Occupation ("I'm a developer")
- Possessions ("I have a dog")
- Location ("I'm from NYC")

### Control Sounds
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.setItem('soundSettings', JSON.stringify({
  enabled: true,
  volume: 0.5
}))
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Affection meter not showing
- Check if user is in incognito mode (disabled in incognito)
- Verify database migration ran
- Check browser console for errors

### Quest modal not appearing
- Needs 5+ messages first
- Random chance (10-40% based on affection)
- Only in non-incognito mode

### Typing animation not working
- Check if response has `typingDelay` field
- Verify TypingIndicator component imported
- Look for `isTyping` state in console

### Sounds not playing
- Add audio files to `/client/public/sounds/`
- Check browser autoplay policy
- Verify sounds enabled in localStorage

### Memory not working
- Check `companion_context` table has data
- Verify user_id matches current user
- Look for `remembered_facts` in database

## 📊 Testing the Features

### Test Affection System
```
1. Send 10 messages
2. Should see: +10 points on meter
3. Watch progress bar fill
4. At 100 points → Level-up animation
```

### Test Quests
```
1. Chat for 10+ messages
2. Quest modal should appear
3. Try answering wrong → +1 affection
4. Answer correctly → +5 affection + celebration
```

### Test Memory
```
1. Say: "My name is Alex and I love gaming"
2. Come back tomorrow
3. Should see: "Hey Alex! I remember you love gaming..."
```

### Test Typing Animation
```
1. Send message
2. Watch for "typing..." indicator
3. See letter-by-letter reveal
4. Hover to see "Click to skip"
```

## 🎯 Known Limitations

### Currently NOT Implemented:
1. ⏰ WebSocket for character-initiated messages
   - Time-based ("Good morning!")
   - Inactivity ("Hey! Long time no chat!")
   - These require real-time server integration

2. 📊 Default typing speeds for existing characters
   - Need to run script to set speeds per character
   - Based on personality (fast/slow)

### Workarounds:
- Quest triggers handle engagement (instead of initiative messages)
- All characters use default 50ms typing speed
- Contextual greetings on chat open (instead of push notifications)

## 🚀 Next Session

To continue development:
```bash
# 1. Start servers
.\restart-all.ps1

# 2. Open chat with any character
# 3. Features work automatically!
# 4. Check browser console for logs
```

## 📈 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:
- ✅ Heart meter in chat header
- ✅ "Character is typing..." before responses
- ✅ Letter-by-letter text animation
- ✅ Quest modal after several messages
- ✅ Confetti when leveling up
- ✅ Contextual greetings on return
- ✅ Progress bar updates after messages

## 💡 Tips

1. **Fastest Way to Level Up**:
   - Complete quests (+5 to +8)
   - Daily check-ins (+3)
   - Long conversations (+1 per message)

2. **Get More Quests**:
   - Higher affection = more quest chances
   - Keep chatting (every 10 messages boosts odds)

3. **Better AI Memory**:
   - Be specific ("My name is..." not "I'm...")
   - Mention interests explicitly ("I love...")
   - Express feelings ("I'm feeling...")

4. **Optimal Experience**:
   - Use desktop for best animations
   - Enable sounds for full immersion
   - Return daily for bonuses
   - Try different characters (each has unique quests)
