- **Static Serving**: ✅ Express serves React app from `client/dist/`

### ✅ **Auto-Deployment Ready**
Since the code has been pushed to git and Railway is configured:

1. **If Railway is connected to your GitHub repo**: 
   - ✅ Automatic deployment will trigger
   - ✅ Build will start within 1-2 minutes
   - ✅ App will be available at your Railway URL

2. **If Railway is NOT connected yet**:
   - 🔗 Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
   - 🚀 Railway will automatically detect the `nixpacks.toml` config
   - ⚡ Deploy will start immediately
