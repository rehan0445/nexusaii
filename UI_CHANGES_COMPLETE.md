### 3. **Auto-Refresh for Votes (Every 2 Seconds)**
- **Location**: `client/src/components/ConfessionPage.tsx` (lines 819-863)
- **What was added**:
  ```typescript
  // Auto-refresh votes every 2 seconds
  useEffect(() => {
    const refreshVotes = async () => {
      // Only refresh if we have confessions loaded
      if (confessions.length === 0) return;
      
      try {
        // Fetch latest confession data to get updated vote counts
        const confessionIds = confessions.map(c => c.id).slice(0, 20); // Limit to first 20 for performance
        
        // Fetch each confession's current vote state from the server
        for (const id of confessionIds) {
          try {
            const response = await apiFetch(`${getServerUrl()}/api/confessions/${id}`, {
              method: 'GET'
            });
            const result = await response.json();
            
            if (result.success && result.data) {
              // Update the confession with fresh vote data
              setConfessions(prev => prev.map(c => 
                c.id === id 
                  ? { ...c, score: result.data.score, userVote: result.data.userVote ?? c.userVote }
                  : c
              ));
            }
          } catch (error) {
            // Silently fail for individual confessions
            console.debug(`Failed to refresh votes for confession ${id}`);
          }
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.debug('Auto-refresh votes failed:', error);
      }
    };

    // Initial refresh
    refreshVotes();

    // Set up interval for auto-refresh every 2 seconds
    const intervalId = setInterval(refreshVotes, 2000);

    // Cleanup interval on unmount
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, [confessions.length]); // Re-run when confession count changes
  ```

**Features**:
- ✅ Polls server every 2 seconds for fresh vote counts
- ✅ Updates upvote/downvote scores automatically
- ✅ Updates user's vote state (which vote button is active)
- ✅ Limits to first 20 confessions for performance
- ✅ Fails silently on errors (no user-facing errors)
- ✅ Cleans up interval on component unmount

**Result**: Vote counts and vote button states refresh automatically every 2 seconds, ensuring users always see the latest vote data.

## 🧹 Cleanup Performed

### Unused Imports Removed:
- ❌ `Trash2` from lucide-react (was used for delete button)

### Unused State Variables Removed:
- ❌ `openReactionPickerId` - tracked which confession's reaction picker was open
- ❌ `reactionPickerSide` - tracked positioning of reaction picker
- ❌ `setOpenReactionPickerId` - setter for reaction picker state
- ❌ `setReactionPickerSide` - setter for picker position

---

## 📊 Current Confession UI Features

### Still Active:
✅ **Upvote/Downvote Buttons** - With auto-refresh every 2 seconds  
✅ **Comment Button** - Opens comment section  
✅ **Poll Voting** - For confessions with polls  
✅ **View Confession Details** - Click to see full thread  
✅ **Share Functionality** - Copy link to confession  

### Removed:
❌ **Delete Button** - No longer visible  
❌ **React Button** - No longer visible

## 🚀 Testing the Changes

### Test Auto-Refresh:
1. Open confession page
2. Have another user upvote a confession
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. Verify vote count updates automatically without page refresh

### Test Button Removal:
1. Open confession page
2. Verify no delete button on your own confessions
3. Verify no react button on any confession
4. Verify upvote/downvote buttons still work

---

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Performance Considerations:
- Auto-refresh is limited to first 20 visible confessions
- Each confession is fetched individually (not a batch request)
- Failed requests are silently ignored to avoid console spam
- Interval is cleared when component unmounts to prevent memory leaks

### Network Load:
- **Requests per 2 seconds**: Up to 20 (one per confession)
- **Total requests per minute**: Up to 600 (20 confessions × 30 intervals)
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding a batch endpoint in future (`/api/confessions/batch-status`) to reduce network load

## 📝 Notes

1. **Backend API Not Modified**: The delete and react endpoints still exist on the backend, they're just not accessible from the UI.

2. **Socket.io Still Active**: The Socket.io `vote-update` events still work, providing real-time updates when votes happen. The 2-second auto-refresh is an additional layer to ensure consistency.

3. **Vote Data Consistency**: The combination of Socket.io real-time updates + 2-second polling ensures users always see the latest vote data, even if WebSocket connection is flaky.

- ✅ No delete button
